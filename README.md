# Modelling-an-Ace
The juptyer notebook looks at tennis datasets taken from [The Match Charting Project](https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_MatchChartingProject) and investigates factors that determine an ace. (An ace is defined as a winning serve that is not touched by the receiver). These factors are then used in a supervised learning classification algorithm to predict if a serve would be an ace.
